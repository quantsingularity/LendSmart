## Project Overview

LendSmart is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to revolutionize peer-to-peer lending. It leverages blockchain technology for transparency, AI for borrower risk assessment, and smart contracts to automate loan agreements.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Lending**: Direct interaction between borrowers and lenders through smart contracts
- **AI-Powered Risk Assessment**: Machine learning models for evaluating borrower creditworthiness
- **Smart Contracts for Automation**: Secure loan agreements with automatic disbursement and repayment handling
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchain-based tamper-proof and transparent loan transactions
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Global accessibility through support for multiple currencies
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive dashboards for both borrowers and lenders

## Core Technologies

LendSmart is built using the following technologies:

1. **Blockchain**:
    - Ethereum/Polygon for smart contract deployment and transaction management

2. **AI/ML**:
    - Python with TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for credit risk models

3. **Smart Contracts**:
    - Solidity for implementing loan agreements and data management

4. **Database**:
    - MongoDB for off-chain storage of borrower and loan data

5. **Frontend**:
    - React.js for creating a responsive and intuitive user interface

6. **Backend**:
    - Node.js with Express for API endpoints and business logic

7. **Infrastructure**:
    - Kubernetes for container orchestration
    - Terraform for infrastructure as code
    - Ansible for configuration management
